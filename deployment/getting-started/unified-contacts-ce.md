# Unified Contacts CE

The deployment of Unified Contacts Community Edition (CE) is similar to the [deployment of Unified Contacts Pro](unified-contacts-pro.md). The two edition use the same binaries for setup. The main difference is that you do not enter a license key.&#x20;

You can upgrade a Community Edition to Pro at any time, by [adding the license key](../../advanced-configuration/license-key.md) and restart the app service.
