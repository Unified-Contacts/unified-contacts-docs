### Our Service

Unified Contacts is a software solution developed by glueckkanja-gab AG that supports the usage of your contacts in Microsoft Teams. See our website and docs for more details on the solution.

We offer two operations models:

* **Software as a service (SaaS)**\
  operated by glueckkanja-gab AG
* **Azure App**\
  operated by the customer

### Purchase and Subscriptions&#x20;

#### Unified Contacts Community Edition&#x20;

The Service is provided free of charge.&#x20;

#### Unified Contacts Enterprise Edition

The Service is billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). With a Subscription, you will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle(s)"). Billing cycles are set on either a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when you purchase a Subscription. If you initially install the free Community Edition and later decide to purchase a subscription to the Enterprise Edition, our licensing mechanism will automatically convert the Community Edition to the Enterprise Edition. The day of activation corresponds to the subscription start date.

### Changes to the Fees

glueckkanja-gab AG may, at its sole discretion and at any time, change the subscription fees. Any change in subscription fees will take effect at the end of the current billing period. We will provide you with reasonable notice, no later than three months prior to the effective date, of any change in Subscription Fees. You may then cancel the subscription in due time.

Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of the change in subscription fees will be deemed to be your agreement to pay the revised amount of the subscription fees.

### Refunds

Unless required by law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable.

### Termination

After cancellation of the Service, it will be terminated at the end of the current term.

Provided you no longer wish to use our Service immediately, you may delete the app from your Microsoft Teams Admin Center or revoke the app permissions in your tenant. Search queries will then no longer be possible for your users.

We may terminate your tenant from our Service without notice or liability if you violate these terms. Upon termination of your Subscription, your right to use the Service will terminate as of the termination date.&#x20;
