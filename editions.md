# Editions

Overview
--------

We offer two different editions of Unified Contacts:

* Unified Contacts Pro
* Unified Contacts Free

While both versions have a similar code base, a **conversion between the versions is not possible**, foremost due to the different backend hosting model (SaaS vs. customer tenant deployment). Thus, if you are looking to test the enterprise features of Unified Contacts Pro, please request a trial key from us first.

## Unified Contacts Pro

Unified Contacts Pro comes with all features and is supported by our team. We charge a subscription fee for Unified Contacts Pro.

We recommend Unified Contacts Pro for:

* Productive environments
* Scalability and performance
* Enterprise feature set

## Unified Contacts Free

Unified Contacts Free misses some features of Unified Contacts Pro and is not supported by our team. Unified Contacts Free is free of charge.

We recommend Unified Contacts Free:

* To experience the look and feel of Unified Contacts without any commitments
* Use-cases that do no require access to third party databases
