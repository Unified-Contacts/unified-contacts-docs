# Editions

Right now, **Unified Contacts** is available as a free **Community Edition (CE)**. The Community Edition is delivered by our Software as a Service (SaaS) platform.

The Community Edition is currently provided without any restrictions (i.e. no requests limits) and the full feature set is unlocked.&#x20;

The app is provided as is and we provide limited support to the best of our ability.

In the future, we plan to offer an additional **Enterprise Edition (EE)** of Unified Contacts with more enterprise-oriented features.&#x20;

For example, Unified Contact's EE can then also be installed in _your_ Azure tenant and therefor provides you with a more extensive range of features while complying with stricter privacy requirements at the same time. Furthermore, we are currently working on an enterprise-grade feature that will allow you to search for contacts in other data sources (e.g. 3rd party CRM systems).
