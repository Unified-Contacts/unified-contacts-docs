# Release Channels

We offer Unified Contacts Pro in different release channels, allowing you to deploy the latest stable version to your production environment, while giving you access to preview or even experimental features at an early stage in your lab/staging environment.

To switch from the default release channel "stable", open the Unified Contacts backend, navigate to the "Update" tab and select the desired release channel. To complete the switch, you must go through the [Update Procedure](release-channels.md#update-procedure) described above.

Please find below an overview of the different release channels:
