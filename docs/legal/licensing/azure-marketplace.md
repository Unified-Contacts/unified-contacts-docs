# Azure Marketplace

## Pricing Model

* Unified Contacts Pro is offered as a **monthly or** **annual subscription plan** with different [User Segments](azure-marketplace.md#user-segments). The correct **user segment** is automatically selected by our platform based on the amount of desired users.
* All subscription plans consist of a **base fee** which includes a certain amount of users per subscription cycle - depending on the **user segment**. For example, the **base fee** for the user segment _Unified Contacts Pro (M) 100_ includes 100 users per month.
* If more than the included amount of users is required, **additional users** can be added to the  plan. For each additional user, we charge an additional per-user fee.

## Invoicing

* During the first subscription interval, your subscription fees are not immediately due after completing the subscription enrolment. Instead we will start billing once your cancellation grace period has expired.&#x20;
* Upon every renewal date, you will be billed immediately.
* The related items should appear on your Microsoft Azure invoice (Pay-As-You-Go) the month after we have reported your fees to Microsoft.
* In the PDF invoice you will receive from Microsoft, all Unified Contacts fees are lumped into an item called "SaaS". The related Publisher is "glueckkanja-gab".
