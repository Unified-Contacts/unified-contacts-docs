## Overview

Unified Contacts extends Microsoft Teams by delivering a unified search experience for the two most popular address books â€“ **Azure Active Directory** as the corporate address book and **Microsoft Exchange Online** as the personal contact store. Additionally, Unified Contacts automatically searches **SharePoint Online** for contact-type lists, allowing the integration with 3rd party contact databases and CRM systems.

Unified Contacts matches the following contact properties against your search query and presents the results in a familiar, comprehensive and coherent format across different contact sources:

* First name
* Last name
* Job title
* Department
* Organization name&#x20;

Unified Contacts comes in two editions, where **Unified Contacts Free** comes as a SaaS solution with limited functionality and where the backend is centrally hosted in our Azure tenant. For enterprise-scenarios, we offer **Unified Contacts Pro** with additional functionality and configuration options along with a backend that gets deployed into **your Azure tenant**.
